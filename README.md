# Nascimento.Software.Projeto.RallyTotalV2


A simple project just for learning and improving .NET skills. I created the database and tables by hand, and used Dapper to access it

The main goal of this project is to create a E-WRC market clone https://www.ewrc-market.com/   plus a Rally news Portal, like DirtFish

In this first commit the user can create a sale and see all cars available to buy

Create a sale page, I used SummerNote plugin and a upload file technique that I learn with a indian guy from youtube (Thank you mate)

Follow him, this guy's great

Also, before creating a sale you must create a car category and a person (Seller)


ToDo: Sale -> Details/Delete/Edit

News Portal coming soon
